## Getting Started

If you're completely new to Jekyll, I recommend checking out the documentation at [http://jekyllrb.com]()

## Installing Jekyll

If you don't have Jekyll already installed, you will need to go ahead and do that.
```
$ gem install jekyll
```

Verify your Jekyll version

It's important to also check your version of Jekyll.
```
$ jekyll -v
jekyll 3.0.1
```
