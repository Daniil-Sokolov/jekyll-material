If you're completely new to Jekyll, I recommend checking out the documentation at [http://jekyllrb.com]

## Installing Jekyll

If you don't have Jekyll already installed, you will need to go ahead and do that. <br>
{% highlight shell linenos %}
 $ gem install jekyll
 $ jekyll -v # Verify your Jekyll version
 jekyll 3.0.1
{% endhighlight %}
