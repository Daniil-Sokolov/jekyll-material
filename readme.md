## Getting Started

If you're completely new to Jekyll, I recommend checking out the documentation at [http://jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com)

### Installing Jekyll

If you don't have Jekyll already installed, you will need to go ahead and do that.
```shell
$ gem install jekyll
```

### Verify your Jekyll version

It's important to also check your version of Jekyll.
```shell
$ jekyll -v
jekyll 3.0.1
```

## Contributing
### Fork, then clone
Fork the repo, and then clone it so you've got the code locally.

### New feature
```shell
git checkout -b my-new-feature
git commit -am "New feature"
git push origin my-new-feature
```

### Other thing
```
vi file
git add file
